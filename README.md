## Intresting things about JS
1. First version of JS was named MOCHA and it was very basic Java and had a special syntax, with some of recent JS features like: first class functions & dynamic typing and prototype inheritance.
2. The next version got named "LiveScript" and then few months later back in Dec-1995 it was named Java Script.
3. JSON Was created by someone called Douglas Crockford back in 2003.
4. Ryan Dahl created Node.js back in 2009.

### Differnces between JS and Node.js?
- Js is a programming language used to make your pages more dynamic, whereas Node.js is a runtime environment for JS to run outside the browser:
  So when you type the word "node" in your terminal and excute JS things, node.js is what gives you that ability whereas JS can be executed using the developer tools console in your web browser.

### Mini Notes
- Every variable you can use in JS is stored inside an object named ```window```. In the browser console you can access that but in the terminal you have to type the word: ```global``` ðŸ˜ƒ
