## Intresting things about JS
1. First version of JS was named MOCHA and it was very basic Java and had a special syntax, with some of recent JS features like: first class functions & dynamic typing and prototype inheritance.
2. The next version got named "LiveScript" and then few months later back in Dec-1995 it was named Java Script.
