## Intresting things about JS
1. First version of JS was named MOCHA and it was very basic Java and had a special syntax, with some of recent JS features like: first class functions & dynamic typing and prototype inheritance.
2. The next version got named "LiveScript" and then few months later back in Dec-1995 it was named Java Script.
3. JSON Was created by someone called Douglas Crockford back in 2003.
4. Ryan Dahl created Node.js back in 2009.

### Differnces between JS and Node.js?
- Js is a programming language used to make your pages more dynamic, whereas Node.js is a runtime environment for JS to run outside the browser:
  So when you type the word "node" in your terminal and excute JS things, node.js is what gives you that ability whereas JS can be executed using the developer tools console in your web browser.
### How to exit the console?
Type: ```.exit```

## The CSS editor in your developer tools thing

The rules applied to the current element are shown in order of most-to-least-specific.
Click the checkboxes next to each declaration to see what would happen if you removed the declaration.
Click the little arrow next to each shorthand property to show the property's longhand equivalents.
Click a property name or value to bring up a text box, where you can key in a new value to get a live preview of a style change.
Next to each rule is the file name and line number the rule is defined in. Clicking that rule causes the dev tools to jump to show it in its own view, where it can generally be edited and saved.
You can also click the closing curly brace of any rule to bring up a text box on a new line, where you can write a completely new declaration for your page.

## Conditions in JS:
1. You can use { } to include the codes or not inside the ifs, however it's recommanded you use them.

### Mini Notes
- Every variable you can use in JS is stored inside an object named ```window```. In the browser console you can access that but in the terminal you have to type the word: ```global``` ðŸ˜ƒ
- What does ```nvm``` stands for?
  Node Version Manager because it makes it easy to change Node versions and upgrade Node, while ```npm``` is used to install the various libraries and tools used in JavaScript environments.
